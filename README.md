# Reservo Background and Purpose

Reservo began as a personal project with **the goal of learning and experimenting firsthand with microservices architecture**, understanding both its strengths and challenges while building a solution to manage auditorium reservations.

I also wanted to explore a technology outside the JavaScript ecosystem for building web servers, so I chose Java 17 with Spring Boot as the project's core. This journey allowed me to acquire new knowledge, reinforce best practices, and build a repository designed to offer a clean and maintainable development experience.

I recognize that the distribution of responsibilities among the microservices could have been simplified. However, I wanted to challenge myself by simulating a more complex environment, where orchestrating multiple services simultaneously was necessary. While this made the process more demanding, it also gave me a deeper understanding of what it means to work with this type of architecture at a larger scale.

Reservo is composed of five repositories:

- [Frontend built with Astro and React 🚀](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-front)
- [NestJS API Gateway responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservice 🧠](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-api-gateway)
- [Spring Boot microservice that handles CRUD operations for core entities 🎨](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-events-user-ms)
- [Hybrid NestJS app that uses WebSockets and communicates across services ⌚](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-ws-ms)
- [NestJS microservice dedicated to authentication 🔐](https://github.com/Hector-f-Romero/reservo-auth-ms)

Each repository includes documentation on the main challenges faced and lessons learned throughout development. Looking back, I feel proud of the effort invested and the outcome achieved with this project.

# Reservo Gateway 🧠

This project is an API Gateway developed with NestJS, serving as the centralized entry point for the entire Reservo ecosystem. Its main responsibilities include:

- Acting as an intermediary between the frontend and various microservices.
- Managing authentication through JWTs stored in cookies.
- Centralizing error handling across microservices.
- Communicating with services using NATS as the message broker.
- Providing a REST API documented with Swagger.

NATS was chosen as the message broker due to its simplicity and ease of deployment via Docker, allowing me to focus on business logic without the overhead of complex configuration. The repository includes a `docker-compose` file to spin up the NATS server before running the gateway.

One of the main challenges in this repository was standardizing how responses were handled between services. To solve this, I developed a `NatsClientWrapper` class that establishes a single connection to the broker and processes responses based on a code attribute returned by the microservices.

# Environment Setup ⚙

## Prerequisites
- Node 22.12.0
- Docker Desktop
- pnpm 10.8.0

## Project Initialization

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies using the package manager: `pnpm install`.
3. Create the environment variables file with: `cp .env.example .env`.
4. Fill in the required values in the `.env` file.
5. Start the NATS server with: `docker-compose up -d`.
6. Run the Gateway server with: `pnpm run start:dev`.
7. Make sure the following services are running:
   - Reservo Auth MS
   - Reservo Events User MS
   - Reservo WebSocket MS.
8. Send an `HTTP POST` request to the `/V1/seed` endpoint to populate the database with test data.

By default, the API documentation is available at: `http://localhost:3000/api` .
